# About

I’m **Kelvin Mo**, a 24-year-old first-year PhD student in **Biological and Biomedical Sciences** at **Harvard University**.  
My work lives at the intersection of **cancer immunology** and **computational biology**.

## The Story: “Hacking the Academic System”
At Stanford’s Mackall Lab, computation was often outsourced. I combined molecular biology + data science to propose an independent project on the first on-treatment scRNA-seq dataset for CAR T therapy, collaborating across clinicians, computational scientists, and technicians.
