    narrative: [
      "I am a 24-year-old first-year PhD student in Harvard's Biological and Biomedical Sciences program. My north star is to engineer immune therapies that are as programmable as software by fusing rigorous biology with modern machine learning.",
      "Before Harvard, I split my undergraduate journey between UC San Diego and UC Berkeley while working closely with clinician-scientists at Stanford, Genentech, Novartis, and Intel. Across these teams I built computational systems that translated raw experimental data into strategies for therapeutics and manufacturing.",

      "I learned wet-lab workflows so I could map every experimental decision to its computational twin. Nights were spent pairing scRNA-seq processing scripts with the clinical metadata our fellows captured in real time.",
      "The result was the first on-treatment single-cell atlas for CAR T therapy in the lab. It uncovered IRF4/IRF8-driven exhaustion programs and chemokine circuits that have since shaped prospective trials."
